<b>March 19th:</b> I read a suggestion to just make sure to put up some code every single day, even if it's terrible code. I'm in an interesting position because although I lived and breathed HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL for many years, I stopped doing any of it for a long time. My biggest challenge is just going to be pulling what I used to know from the depths of my memory, and learning what's changed since then. Fortunately, I am sure this means that I will make progress quickly.
